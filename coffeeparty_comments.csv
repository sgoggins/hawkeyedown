I especially like where Jobs talks about one of his Chinese factories: ""Its a factory, but my gosh, I mean they've got restaurants and movie theatres and hospitals and swimming pools....... its a pretty nice factory.""

Independent investigators disagreed in their report- instead, 72-hour work weeks, forced overtime, debilitating stress injuries, child labor, overcrowded barracks....chemical poisonings, falsified records, humiliating punishments and deadly explosions were the realities of that ""pretty nice factory.""

Jim Hightower makes a great comment when he says apparently Jobs had no ""app for corporate morality.""

The icing on the cake..... Steve Jobs later tells roll-over-Obama to expect himself to be a one-term President. Because after all, he didn't play ball and aid in outsourcing America's jobforce (and exploiting Chinese workers) enough:

'Calgary-based TransCanada Corp.'s 1,700-mile pipeline is designed to carry crude oil from tar sands near Hardisty, Alberta, through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The pipeline also would move 100,000 barrels of crude daily, largely from North Dakota's burgeoning oil patch and some from Montana.
….Wayde Schafer, a North Dakota spokesman for the Sierra Club, said Obama's decision was appropriate though oil that would have moved on the pipeline will be transported by environmentally riskier rail or trucks
""There is no question that oil by rail or truck is much more dangerous than a pipeline, but then again, you have to have adequate time and you have to site a pipeline appropriately or you're just asking for trouble,"" Schafer said.'   http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57363033/more-nd-oil-will-be-railed-with-no-us-pipeline/",2012-02-18T03:04:24+0000

For Hansen, the threat is twofold. First, oil sands produce more polluting than the conventional extraction process. Moreover, the activity undermines one of the best tools for reducing carbon on Earth: the Canadian boreal forest. According to the scientist, it stores more carbon per hectare than any other ecosystem, and when it is cleared for the development of the oil sands industry, much of this carbon is lost. Hansen also points out that the forest contains much of the freshwater in North America, in addition to housing some 5 billion migratory birds and some of the largest remaining populations of moose, bears, wolves and caribou in the world.

Personally, I have no desire to live in the type of society you describe.  Not because I don't care about people, and I do think people should have a fair opportunity to achieve the things you mention.  But a government that has the power and authority over almost every aspect of our lives to turn those items into rights is not the type of government I wish to live under.  And do you believe that a government that powerful would only do good things that you approve of?  Of course not.  
You can already look at the government we have today, which is not nearly as all encompassing as the type of government you are advocating for, and still we have the patriot act, section 1021 of the Obama signed NDAA, invasive searches by the TSA, and the list goes on with all sorts of laws that violate our civil liberties and individual rights.

Each believed their way the right way to do things and either forced or at least encouraged their citizenry to fall in line and follow suit. When forming the United States, the founders hammered out a compromise: states could do what they wished inside their own borders, while the federal government would only regulate commerce between states and it would not endorse a particular religion. By stepping in to enforce rules contrary to the religion of many, the federal government has broken this compromise. Given the growing incivility today, it would seem that a return to this type of compromise (you go your way and I go mine) is in order.",2012-02-14T22:04:20+0000

From a purely economic standpoint, it makes sense for many individuals to serve in the military. It must be framed as an economic decision, because the military hardly serves the purpose that all the rhetoric surrounding it would have you to think, i.e. defending freedom, serving country, etc. Our military has been co-opted and corrupted by corporate influence. I myself wish I had a military to serve in for a cause I believe in. Iraq was not about WMDs or defending freedom; the whole ""war on terror"" is hardly about protecting america, and 9/11 served as an excuse to start an unending imperial war to secure resources for corporate profit (incidentally, 8 years into our occupation in afghanistan, we just ""stumbled"" across vast unexploited copper and uranium deposits). To accept that the military is about protecting freedom and american civilians today is to believe in a lie. So I don't blame people for joining the military when often it is the only viable choice they have to support their families, but if they join the military under the pretense they are protecting freedom and the rights of civilians, and discount the notion that the military has become an institution of corporate-domination, and that as members of the armed services they too are serving corporations; than yes, I have qualms with those individuals because they are deluded and refuse to accept they are serving a corrupt regime.",2012-02-13T01:34:15+0000

Virtue essentially means promoting the public good over special interests.  This ""intent"" was not specifically in the Constitution, but three of the signers of the Constitution made it specific in the letters of the Federalist Papers.

There are three thing to consider about the problem of corporations.

Vote!  We have to stop electing people who receive less votes than the number of people who don't show up at elections.

If biological U.S. persons are taxable on their worldwide income, shouldn't corporate U.S. persons be taxable on their worldwide income?  Conversely, if corporate persons are not taxable on such income, shouldn't biological persons be not taxable on such income.

""It is the stock that is employed for the sake of profit, which puts into motion the greater part of the useful labour of every society. The plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all the most important operation of labour, and profit is the end proposed by all those plans and projects.  But the rate of profit does not, like rent and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension of the society. On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor countries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin."" - Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations",2012-02-11T16:26:30+0000

I think the tax code was purposely written to be the overly complicated jumbled up mess it is so that average Americans couldn't understand it, and as a result not understand just how much the tax code screws the average American.  I have seen a few articles here on the CPM in the past about reforming the tax code to a flatter type of tax, not a complete flat tax but a simpler flatter type of tax code.  If you remove a great many loopholes, shelters, exemptions and subsidies we could actually lower the corporate tax rate and still bring in more revenue than today.  The reason I think it hasn't happened yet, and may never happen, is the well funded special interest groups who wrote our tax code see no benefit in it for them.",2012-02-09T04:18:57+0000
