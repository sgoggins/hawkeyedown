""About the Information Diet

Healthy information consumption habits are about more than productivity and efficiency. They're about your personal health, and the health of society. Just as junk food can lead to obesity, junk information can lead to new forms of ignorance. The Information Diet provides a framework for consuming information in a healthy way, by showing you what to look for, what to avoid, and how to be selective. In the process, author Clay Johnson explains the role information has played throughout history, and why following his prescribed diet is essential in today's information age.""

We are trying to get funding for a start up venture called Operation Enduring Canary. 

This is the next step to an already failed venture called Operation Enduring Butterfly. Operation Enduring Butterfly failed for a lack of support, primarily, and secondarily because of the inane amounts of money spent by the mainscream media to keep things just as they are, and finally because there are no more Butterfly's alive anywhere on planet Earth now, so, it is pointless now to try to maintain it. The Butterfly's all died of Hypoxia, just as the remaining bird species are all about to. Albert Einstein said many decades ago that it is a mistake for us to share our world with devices that, like me, consume Oxygen. Hypoxia is death by a lack of sufficient Oxygen. 

Anyway, we have documentation, data, everything required to prevent this catastrophe from engulfing every other species inside the Animal Kingdom, we just do not have the funds necessary to continue, having spent everything we had trying to save the Butterfly's. 

We also have our own environmentally controlled buildings with Oxygen generation, Oxygen sensors, and food growing capabilities, we just would rather you all made it into the future as well. And yeah, we also have gas masks that will enable us to go outside when the conditions outside get to that point, which, nothing is being done to stop it, so, it is going to. Our Oxygen level was 25.04% when Einstein checked it, and now it is down to 19.56% and falling. At around 19.50% human beings will begin loosing consciousness. With nothing but increases in fossil fuel consumption, that could occur this year, and, as most of the land mass with vegetation on Earth is in the Northern Hemisphere and many trees loose their leaves in the Winter, we doubt there will be much of anything left in the Animal Kingdom by next February. We know people in South America, Australia, China: everywhere, and, there are barely a single solitary insect to be found anywhere right now. Contact any friends or family you may know anywhere in the world where it is not cold and wintery right now, and simply ask them to go outside and take a picture of an insect. ANY insect. Spiders and Ants are about all they will find. 

Automobiles can run in an environment with as low as a 6% Oxygen content. Good for them, but you will all be long gone and so will every other creature type in the Animal Kingdom. If you'd like to see more evidence, go onto you tube, and in the search bar type in dead birds falling out of the sky. 

As another simple example, for those in a cold and wintery climate right now, when I was a child growing up here, in the Ottawa Valley in Canada, there were more birds and bird species that did not fly south for the winter than there are here now in the summertime. Also, the colony collapse of the bees occurred in 2007, and, it was global. Every continent including all the ones that have no cell towers, were affected. The war on Science was undoubtedly the worst thing that Humanity has ever done. Bar none. 

Anyway, please help us. We are altruistic and care deeply about this. 

My email address is david.cardill(at)yahoo.ca NOTE: that it is dot ca and not dot com. I've actually ran into people in person who have said that they have been trying to contact me for a long time because of that simple mistake. 

Further, we do not need much more than 25 thousand dollars to start a massive Oxygen Enrichment program, one we already believe will work on a grand scale, for, electrolysis (image search that word if you do not know what it means) is simple, and so is electrical production, and electrolysis turns Water into the two elements from which it is comprised: Oxygen and Hydrogen. Both of those gasses are just going to be released into the atmosphere and they both already do exist in our atmosphere, just, obviously, the Oxygen level is falling. At a later date, we fully plan on collecting the Hydrogen. 

Also, the more money we get, the better, because the more people we will be able to have work on this. People can not, in this world, just do things because they want to. Sad but true, and you can just go onto pay pal and send money to my email address. I purposefully set up an account with pay pal, linked to my verified email address and bank account, for this. Tell your accountant or whoever does your taxes that this is a charitable donation and do not take no for an answer.

All Freedom Loving American's should be outraged at the blatant systematic shunning of the most qualified and honest true conservative candidate to come along in a very very long time.

The GOP/RNC & Main Stream Media have put a virtual blockade on Gov. Buddy Roemer who is the only candidate who TRULY has the interests of average american people as his agenda.
Gov. Roemer has been in the GOP race for President from the very begininning and has not been allowed to participate in a single debate and gets very little media attention despite the fact that he is a 4 term Congressman, former Gov. of Louisianna, and successful banker who started community banks from the ground up that recieved no bailout money and did not foreclose on one single homeowner! In a time when big banks took huge amounts of bailout money and foreclosures are rampant, that is really saying something!  

He is the only candidate that has the integrity to take action against Special Interests NOW! He proves it by putting the money where his mouth is and currently runs his campaign with self imposed limits of $100 max. contribution. 
No PAC's or Super PAC's. Roemer is the only candidate who has been granted Matching Funds from the FEC because his donations are recieved in small  amounts from all across America which means he is the most likely of all to represent us than any other candidate including our current President.  

I am not asking anyone to just trust me in my support of Gov. Roemer. We have enough sheep already in this campaign. I would hope, however, that if you are fed up with business as usual when it comes to Washington and this election that you will take a little time to research him on your own. There are plenty of videos of interviews and speeches that he has given on youtube as well as articles and op. eds written by and about him.

Here is a link to an ad that his campaign ran during the NH Primary:

http://youtu.be/h7y2l29BVNg

""We Need to Wake Up America! They Have Stolen Our Govt."" - Buddy Roemer

Despite what the media and the established status quo will lead you to believe, there is still plenty of time left to choose a candidate that best represents us.

Thank You For Your Time!

Washington continues to advance his idea of the dangers of sectionalism and expands his warning to include the dangers of political parties to the government and country as a whole. His warnings took on added significance with the recent creation of the Democratic-Republican Party by Jefferson, to oppose Hamilton's Federalist Party, which had been created a year earlier in 1791, which in many ways promoted the interest of certain regions and groups of Americans over others. A more pressing concern for Washington, which he makes reference to in this portion of the address, was the Democratic-Republican efforts to align with France and the Federalist efforts to ally the nation with Great Britain in an ongoing conflict between the two European nations brought about by the French Revolution.

While Washington accepts the fact that it is natural for people to organize and operate within groups like political parties, he also argues that every government has recognized political parties as an enemy and has sought to repress them because of their tendency to seek more power than other groups and take revenge on political opponents.[11].

Moreover, Washington makes the case that ""the alternate domination"" of one party over another and coinciding efforts to exact revenge upon their opponents have led to horrible atrocities, and ""is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism."" From Washington's perspective and judgment, the tendency of political parties toward permanent despotism is because they eventually and ""gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual.""[12]

Washington goes on to acknowledge the fact that parties are sometimes beneficial in promoting liberty in monarchies, but argues that political parties must be restrained in a popularly elected government because of their tendency to distract the government from their duties, create unfounded jealousies among groups and regions, raise false alarms amongst the people, promote riots and insurrection, and provide foreign nations and interests access to the government where they can impose their will upon the country.

Now I understand that any action that does not create tension to knock the majority out of their desire to keep things ""stable"" will not succeed in bringing about change. They will not respond to the cries of the people unless they feel pressured to do so. 
I have so admired the Coffee Party Movement eff...orts to keep tension out of the discourse. And I still hold it in high regard but there was a split by some who believed what Martin Luther King followed: “Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks to so dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.""

""My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.""

Now I must search for a balance between the two that will keep the resistances peaceful but causes enough tension that needed changes do occur. And we must know that when we cause tension it will be met with violent response from the establishment that wishes to maintain the current status they feel secure in.

PROTEST AGAINST ALEC AT THEIR SPRING SUMMIT MEETING.
PROTEST AND TEACH-IN...........PLEASE JOIN US!

On February 29th, Occupy Portland calls for a national day of non-violent direct action to reclaim our voices and challenge our society?s obsession with profit and greed by shutting down the corporations. We are rejecting a society that does not allow us control of our future. We will reclaim our ability to shape our world in a democratic, cooperative, just and sustainable direction. 

We call on people to target corporations that are part of the American Legislative Exchange Council which is a prime example of the way corporations buy off legislators and craft legislation that serves the interests of corporations and not people. They used it to create the anti-labor legislation in Wisconsin and the racist bill SB 1070 in Arizona among so many others. They use ALEC to spread pro big business laws around the country.

I was coerced into going to see ""Safe House"" as part of my job today. It sucked. Unmitigated violence and no coherent plot. FANS LOUD NOISES AND OUTLANDISH BLOODSHED WILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE. I HAPPENED TO OUTGROW THESE TASTES IN THE FIFTH GRADE. Watching a 65 y/o Denzel Washington jump roof-top to roof-top and kill people with impunity while being impervious to bullets himself just gets old after the 50th time you've seen the same movie with a different name. It's the same old celebration of the Ultimate Hombre myth, the John Wayne-esque hyper-individualist rugged survival-of-the-fittest hero; and the continuing glorification of corruption, violence, and the military-industrial-security-technology complex. There was even a scene where there were protesters holding vague signs about no jobs and poor economic conditions, which framed this form of free-speech as a dangerous and fruitless endeavor. Somehow I get the impression Hollywood isn't in the entertainment-for-entertainment's sake business so much as the propaganda business these days.
How about this new movie coming out with purportedly active Navy Seals, ""Act of Valor""? Whose REALLY providing the funding for the production of this brazen piece of military propaganda? This is very troubling to me. The military/nationalist mentality has completely inundated the world of commercial art. Nowadays, if you want to be a successful actor, just join the military; not only will you be treated as a hero/savior by the helpless and terrified civilian population, but you will gain celebrity and wealth as well. Next these guys will be winning american idol, lip sinking Whitney Houston with a mic in the right hand and an M-16 in the left; dressed in desert camo and gunning-down faceless, bearded insurgents without even trying just because they are THAT GOOD, and you would have to be THAT STUPID to stand in opposition to their might.
This is the end of civil-society people. In the America the 1% has planned for us, you will either serve the military-industrial-security-technology complex, or you will be destroyed by it. You will either work for wal-mart, join the marines, or starve. If you are an artist, you will only gain recognition for your value as an entertainer as part of the ""bread-and-circuses"" approach to subduing the population. Goodbye freedom, hello servitude. At least we will be fed and entertained.",status,2012-02-13T00:18:04+0000,2012-02-13T01:36:50+0000

On indicator after indicator, the U.S. compares badly with other rich nations on not only the number of impoverished citizens it has but also on the facilities and opportunities it is giving the poor. That's why social mobility has stalled in America. Compared with other rich countries, poor Americans are more likely to stay poor. More than 40% of American men whose fathers had earnings in the bottom fifth end up in the same bracket. Britain, Denmark, Finland and Norway all perform much better.

The sad part is, these statistics are reversible. Compare child poverty rates in America and the UK. You'll see that the UK's rates were halved within a decade from the mid-1990s. The U.S. has actually risen since then. There's no secret sauce. Tony Blair's Labour government simply made reducing child poverty a priority through various programs.

So, Mitt Romney: Yes, the media took your comments out of context. But you do need to be concerned about the very poor. We all do.""",link,2012-02-12T23:43:35+0000,2012-02-13T00:16:14+0000

FOOD FOR THOUGHT -- according to Facebook, it has 845 Million Active Users. And of that 845 Million, 153 MILLION are AMERICANS!! Wouldn't it be amazing if we could get the President's message to those people??!! There are a lot of undecided Voters out there...some Democrats...some Independents...and yes, even some Republicans. After all, look what the GOP has to offer. Laughable!!

Social media, along with Internet Activism, is a VERY POWERFUL TOOL!! Let's definitely take advantage of this great opportunity that we have to effect PROGRESSIVE change. WE ALL REALLY CAN HELP IN THE PROCESS!! And Facebook has made it so simple for us. When you become a member on any Facebook page, the only effort you really need to make is to SHARE EVERYTHING that you think will help get President Obama re-elected. THAT is our main goal now...right? So SHARE ARTICLES, SHARE PHOTOS, SHARE A STATUS. And along with whatever it is that you are SHARING, make a comment telling your Friends to also SHARE. THAT is how we reach out and that is exactly what we should be doing. Let's go after those 153 MILLION AMERICANS! So here is the mantra...""SHARE SHARE SHARE""...for our President...for our future!!

My husband and I needed help and it looks like the government is just jerking us all off with a smile. Presdent Obama has crossed the line and has become nothing more than a Republican in Democrat clothing. The state Attorney Generals sold out it's ciitizens and President has now join......ed the system of the Super Pac way of collecting campaign funds only because, he claims, that he's the best alternative to the Republican contenders. We don't think so here and we are sure a lot of other Americans can see through him that he's in bed with the banks. We're seniors but if a all out rebellion is needed, we may not be able to be on the front lines but would be willing to help in some way. We need help here in Connecticut and if anyone would like to camp out on our front lawn to help us fight, we are ready. We strongly urge unions and other homeowners, taxpayers of the 99% to do the same. This government stinks and they openly and arrogantly do what the hell they want and do not listen to the 99% because the banks own them and the police. Your government will shoot you down like dogs if that's what they feel is what it takes to keep their butts safe and so they can continue to rule like the same tyrants that you hear them criticizing in other countries about violating human rights and free speech. Bullshit, we say.
Mrs. Ronni Mandell and I'm damn fed up and the bankers must be punished now by us in some major way as the government has given them a slap on the wrist and they are all laughing about it-politicians and bankers alike. 

Jefferson that from time to time, some patriot and tyrant blood has to be shed, we don't want bloodshed but if someone can come up with another way to achieve equality in this country, not including elections, because they are a flagrant joke and none of the candidates are worth a damn.

Hit me back if you wish to help us make our stand. We've been fighting for over a year now with no help from politicians and we won't lay down and play dead for any of these bastards. Pardon my French.
